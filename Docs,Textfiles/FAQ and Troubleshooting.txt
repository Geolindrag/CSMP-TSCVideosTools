		TroubleShooting

"My video is desynced"

The game needs to run stable at 60FPS in order to run the video and audio propperly
As any slowdown will slow the video playback, but not the audio,
One trick to reduce the load is to reduce the resolution of your images to the half
Other is reduced totally the resolution of Cave story, As due to my technicall limitations on my side
i was only able to load a video stable in the lowest resolution of cavestory
You might also want to check yout GPU options (if possible) to limit them to 60FPS

"My images aren't being loaded by any of the programs"

Be sure that you arent running them as admin, Or that the folder is not Write protected
It is worth checking if you accidentally didn't rename the folder as well, in that case
its name is : dropImagesHere

"That didn't work!"

The images must be explicetly .png files, and these should have the .png extension,
as if these are missing the extension for some reason, but are valid .pngs, Wont get loaded
due to the method used to detect them

"CaveEditor is not opening/Taking too long to open the map scripts"

Naturally after torturing the game engine like we did, Map scripts can take a while
to load in Csve editor, just be patient

"My video output is scrambled!"

Make sure your files are sorted from A->Z
If your files are already scrambled, then sorry, The only thing you can do is delete them
and re-export them from the start

"My game is crashing upon loading the map"

You surpassed the 64KB limit of the Map.tsc+head.tsc
You can check your map size by going to /<yourmod>/stages/MapName.tsc
The Head.tsc is on the mod root folder

"My game is crashing upon starting"

Probably something really bad messed up
Check that you didn't add any weird values on CaveEditor

"My game is not crashing, But not loading the images"

Make sure the casing of the folder names is correct



		FAQ (that no one asked, but probably someone will ask)

Q : Higher framerate?
A: I don't think is possible, I've tried to implement it, but at some point seems that the game can't load the images fast enough
maybe this is a performance issue on the almight powerful intelHD Graphics tha t i have, but since i don't
have any other PC/GPU to test it on, i can't develop it on my part

Q:Custom Framerate?
A:Due to the mentioned before question, Frametimes are hard to get so the ones i added are hardcoded
and despite i adding support for 3 Framerates, None of them are perfect
I nfact if you use a long video, Past the 3Mins mark you can notice delay on either the audio/Video
So yea, Adding custom framerate is something that exceeds my abilities

Q:I don't want to install the video editor for framedumping
A: Again, Sorry, thats a skill issue of my part, Since i can barely be called a programmer lol
I would like to some point convert the videos to PNGs without external programs, but again, Skill issues on my part
And i wanted to get this out, so maybe in a far future this will get added

Q:Linux?
A:Since CSMP is windows only (Unless you use Wine/Proton) i really didn't want to suffer and go
to the Linux programming hell, and while it should be easy to just port the windows instructions 
(mostly the I/O related one i would guess) i lack time to do it as right now, or test it, as soon my free time will be non-existant

Q:Compatibility with other CaveStory mods?
A:Im not really into Cave story modding ,I have only worked with CSMP to do stupid/joke mods, and thats all
so i really lack knowledge to answer if it would be compatible with other mods

Q:Hey something broke and the answer isn't here
A:Feel free to ask me either on discord (geolindrag) or github directly (https://github.com/Geolindrag/) i usually respond when i have the time, 
So the max time you may have to wait is 16Hrs~
