Default Head.tsc 2.03KB
The size limit is 64KB for the sum of the Map script+Head.tsc
Any higher size will crash the game

VIDEO TYPES

Reduced size videos
You can store up to 10,000 frames (0000-9999) on the mod root folder
And while that makes the mod folder look ugly,
these use a shorter instruction , and thus, allow you
to play larger videos/save space for map scripting

3932 frames = 61.4 KB Hard limit (Leaves 0.5KB for scripting)
3500 frames =  SafeLimit (leaves 7KB~ for scripting)
64Frames = 1KB~

FPS	SafeDuration	Hard Limit (No map scripting)
5FPS	11:40		13:06 //Unimplemented
10FPS	5:50		6:33
12FPS	4:51		3:27
15FPS	3:53		4:22

Normal videos
These are saved on /yourmod/images/XXXX/ (XXXX being a number)
these ones use an instruction that uses 1.5 the size of the reduced one
thus, limiting the playback time to 75%~
you can save as many of these as you want
(Technically up to 100Million frames, or if a mod size limit exists
but you arent't that crazy right?		right....? )

2928 frames = 61.4 KB Hard limit (Leaves 0.5KB for scripting)
2600 frames =  SafeLimit (leaves 7KB~ for scripting)
48 Frames = 1KB~

FPS	SafeDuration	Hard Limit (No map scripting)
5FPS	8:40		9:44//Unimplemented
10FPS	4:20		4:52
12FPS	3:36		4:04
15FPS	2:53		3:15

Export resolutions (gets auto streched to fit window)
Ratio	FullRes	HalfRes
1:1	240x240	120x120
4:3 	320x240	160x120
16:9 	426x240	214x120
You can go lower on resolution, but at that point looks really bad
You can't go higher on resolution
